# To-Do
These are some features I'd like to have in the future. There's no timeline on when these would be implemented, just kind of a checklist of stuff I want to work on. 

 - [ ] Base App
   - [ ] The Game Table
     - [ ] Allow the states of various table cells to be toggled and changed by the user
   - [ ] Guess Structure
     - [ ] User can initiate a guess
       - [ ] The Guess cycles through each Player, highlighting the necessary column
       - [ ] The user can state whether a Guess is Refuted or not, and the app automatically fills in the data for each column and row accordingly
     - [ ] User can choose 1 Suspect, Item, and Location for the Guess
     - [ ] User can choose which Player the Guess starts with, and the Guess wraps around when starting on a different Player
   - [ ] Deduction
     - [ ] Automatically deduce which card a Player has when they Refute a Guess, based on previously known cards that they don't have
     - [ ] Retroactively deduce which card a Player has when they cannot Refute a Guess, based on a previous Refutation
     - [ ] Once a player's entire hand is known, mark that they don't have all of the other cards
   - [ ] Customizability
     - [ ] User can Create a New Game, and Enter names for any number of players 
     - [ ] User can create custom game sheets, with any number of Suspects, Items, and Locations
       - [ ] User's custom game sheets are accounted for when deducing each Player's Hand
